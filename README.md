###Deathcounter Run

This Borderlands 2 run was inspired by Twitch streamer axsce8. He publicised his 1life route, set out in the file 1life-route and as I do love to follow recipies and guides in general, I felt that I had to give it a try. I'm way too scared to do an actual 1life and also don't want the prospect of having to repeat early stages of the game over and over again, I am doing a death counter run instead. This takes the pressure off somewhat and is based on advice from another Borderlands 2 Twitch streamer Kai_TW, who many would consider a 1life master. I am keeping track of my death count on the top right of the screen and I am keep a track of how I died in the file called death-certificate.

The community one life rules apply to this run such as turning off BAR.
